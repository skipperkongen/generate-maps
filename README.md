# Map Generation

> Pattern recognition applied to noisy inputs

This code repository contains my own recipies for generating fictional geographical maps with computer code. There is a large body of existing work[\[1\]](http://pcg.wikidot.com/pcg-algorithm:map-generation)[\[2\]](http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~torbenm/Planet/)[\[3\]](http://simblob.blogspot.com/2010/09/polygon-map-generation-part-1.html), which my code is *not* based on, because the creative process what makes it fun for me.

All my maps are generated with code in a single notebook.

[map-generation.ipynb](notebooks/map-generation.ipynb)

Essentially, my maps are based on noise (gaussian and beyond) with various spatial clustering algorithms throw on top. More sophisticated
maps used iterative randomness (e.g. brownian motion) and geometric arithmetic/set operations on top (e.g. plus or minus).

## How to run the code

You must have Python 3 already installed.

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd notebooks
jupyter notebook
# in the UI open the file "map-generation.ipynb"
```
